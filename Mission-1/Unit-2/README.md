# Unit 2
You will begin this unit by creating a new project for your second Prototype and getting basic player movement working. You will first choose which character you would like, which types of animals you would like to interact with, and which food you would like to feed those animals. You will give the player basic side-to-side movement just like you did in Prototype 1, but then you will use if-then statements to keep the Player in bounds.
