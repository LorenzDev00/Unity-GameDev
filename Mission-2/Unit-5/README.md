# Unit 5

It’s time for the final unit! We will start off by creating a new project and importing the starter files, then switching the game’s view to 2D. Next we will make a list of target objects for the player to click on: Three “good” objects and one “bad”. The targets will launch spinning into the air after spawning at a random position at the bottom of the map. Lastly, we will allow the player to destroy them with a click!

## Project Outcome:
- A list of three good target objects and one bad target object will spawn in a random position at the bottom of the screen, thrusting themselves into the air with random force and torque. 
- These targets will be destroyed when the player clicks on them or they fall out of bounds.
